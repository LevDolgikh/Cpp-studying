# Cpp-studying
New round of C++ studying (start date: 23/08/2021)

01. Project_Zero  - Hello World programm and some basics: math operations, console input and output;
02. Project_12    - Constants, increment and decrement, logical operations, conditions;
03. Project_3     - Loops;
04. Project_4     - Arrays of numbers, sizeof function, random numbers;

I dont want to learn C++ at all but i have to. That's why i will not do complex programs and i will only learn basics to unrestand how to read c++ code in general.
